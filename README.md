```

## Running the Server

To start the server, navigate to the `video-downloader-server` directory and run:

```
python -m app.main
```

## Using the Video Download Feature

Once the server is running, you can send a POST request to the endpoint (e.g., `/download`) with a JSON body containing the video URL:

    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example"
}
```

The server will process the request and download the video to the specified location.
